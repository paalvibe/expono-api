Expono API Changelog

2009-12-01 version 4361
 - expono.photosets.create
   If no privacy parameter was supplied we used the user default album privacy was used, but it will now be private. We will introduce a new parameter in future update for this e.g "use_default" that will be used for uploads aswell.
 - Fixed error that wouldn't validate OAuth requests that used Authorization header for oauth parameters.
 - oauth_callback to custom URL schemes will now work, useful for e.g iPhone Apps.
 - JSON format added as optional response format.
 - Empty fields e.g description wont return a whitespace character anymore
 - expono.photos.getInfo, comment count is now shown even when 0
 - expono.people.getUploadStatus, no more negative values for storage/bandwith remaining (999999999 is used for people with unlimited)
